The repository of workerman-chat is https://github.com/walkor/workerman-chat which is based on GatewayWorker.You can just clone it into your server and run `composer install` to install it.After we report the bug to them,they just change the registry's address to 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0.The version of GatewayWorker is still before the bersion 3.1.0ï¼Œwhich will also lead to the bug.

The reason for the bug is same to GatewayWorker and because of the introduction of third-party package `revolt`, we figured out  how to execute command in the server.


First,you should run `php start.php start` on the root path of woorkerman-chat.And then copy gateway.php and poc.php to the workerman-chat's root path and run php gateway.php start, you will see the command `ls` is executed in the console of `php start.php start`
